# Quick Setup Guide for TalkTime/JustSpeak

## Current Status
The app is running but needs database configuration to fully work. Here's how to get it running:

## Option 1: Run Without Database (Quick Test)
The app will work for basic conversation practice without saving data.

1. The app is already running at http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Start Conversation" to begin
3. The AI will use browser text-to-speech (ElevenLabs requires fixing the integration)

## Option 2: Full Setup with Supabase

### 1. Set up Supabase
1. Go to https://supabase.com and create a project
2. In your project dashboard, go to Settings > API
3. Copy your project URL and anon key

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
```

### 3. Push Database Schema
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### 4. Re-enable Middleware
```bash
mv middleware.ts.disabled middleware.ts
```

### 5. Restart the server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Current Issues Being Fixed:
1. ElevenLabs integration needs adjustment (falling back to browser TTS)
2. Authentication is optional but causes warnings
3. Session tracking only works with database configured

## Features Working:
- Basic conversation with AI
- Speech recognition (click microphone)
- Learning mode with corrections
- Browser text-to-speech

The app is functional for testing English conversation practice!
