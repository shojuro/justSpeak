# NPM Installation Issue - Manual Resolution Required

## Issue Description
During the deployment preparation, npm install commands are timing out in the WSL environment. This appears to be related to file system permissions and the large number of dependencies.

## Temporary Workaround Applied
The mobile MVP changes have been successfully committed to git without running the full build process.

## Manual Steps Required

### Option 1: Clean Install (Recommended)
```bash
# Remove existing node_modules and lock file
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Option 2: Use Windows Command Prompt
If WSL continues to have issues:
1. Open Command Prompt (not WSL)
2. Navigate to project directory
3. Run: `npm install`

### Option 3: Deploy Directly to Vercel
Since the code changes are committed, you can:
1. Push to GitHub (already done)
2. Let Vercel's build system handle the dependencies
3. Monitor the build logs in Vercel dashboard

## Verification Steps
After successful installation:
```bash
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Mobile MVP code changes completed
- ✅ Git commit created with comprehensive message
- ✅ Changes ready for deployment
- ⚠️ Local build verification pending due to npm issue

## Next Steps
1. Resolve npm installation using one of the options above
2. Verify the build completes successfully
3. Deploy to Vercel (should trigger automatically from GitHub push)
