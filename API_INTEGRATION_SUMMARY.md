# API Integration Summary

## Overview
The JustSpeak application has been successfully updated to use API-based voice and ChatGPT/OpenAI services as requested. All voice features now support multiple providers through a flexible API architecture.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Voice Recognition (Speech-to-Text)
- **Providers Supported:**
  - Browser Web Speech API (Free, works offline)
  - OpenAI Whisper API (High accuracy, requires API key)
  - Google Speech-to-Text API (Excellent accuracy, requires API key)

- **Implementation:**
  - `/app/api/voice/transcribe/route.ts` - API endpoint for transcription
  - `/hooks/useVoiceRecognition.tsx` - React hook with API support
  - Automatic provider selection based on availability

### 2. Voice Synthesis (Text-to-Speech)
- **Providers Supported:**
  - Browser Speech Synthesis (Free, basic quality)
  - OpenAI TTS API (Natural voices, requires API key)
  - ElevenLabs API (Most realistic voices, premium)

- **Implementation:**
  - `/app/api/voice/synthesize/route.ts` - API endpoint for voice synthesis
  - `/hooks/useSpeechSynthesis.tsx` - React hook with API support
  - Multiple voice options per provider

### 3. Chat Integration (OpenAI GPT)
- **Models Supported:**
  - GPT-3.5 Turbo (Default, faster and cheaper)
  - GPT-4 (More advanced, configurable)

- **Implementation:**
  - `/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Enhanced chat endpoint
  - Proper error handling and rate limiting
  - Context management for conversation flow

### 4. Configuration System
- **API Configuration:**
  - `/lib/api-config.ts` - Server-side configuration
  - `/lib/api-config-client.ts` - Client-safe configuration
  - `/app/api/config/status/route.ts` - API status endpoint

- **Features:**
  - Automatic provider detection
  - Fallback to free options when APIs unavailable
  - User preference persistence

### 5. User Interface Updates
- **Provider Selection:**
  - `/components/conversation/ProviderSelector.tsx` - Settings UI
  - Real-time provider switching
  - Visual status indicators

- **Updated Components:**
  - `/components/conversation/ConversationScreen.tsx` - Main conversation interface
  - `/components/conversation/SessionControls.tsx` - Provider settings button
  - Seamless integration with existing UI

## Configuration

To enable API features, add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration (Required for AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Optional: Premium voice synthesis
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key

# Optional: Google Speech recognition
GOOGLE_SPEECH_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

## Testing

Three test files have been created:

1. **`/test-api-integration.html`** - Comprehensive API testing interface
   - Tests all voice providers
   - Interactive conversation testing
   - Debug logging and status monitoring

2. **`/test-voice-integration.html`** - Voice API testing
   - Browser compatibility checks
   - Microphone permissions testing
   - Real-time transcription testing

3. **`/test-onboarding-complete.html`** - Fixed onboarding flow
   - All 4 steps now functional (Goals, Level, Preferences, Summary)
   - Proper state management
   - User preference persistence

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Fallback**: If premium APIs are not available, the system automatically falls back to free browser-based alternatives

2. **Provider Persistence**: User's provider selections are saved to localStorage and restored on page load

3. **Real-time Switching**: Users can switch between providers without restarting their conversation

4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

5. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to prevent API abuse

## Usage

1. The application automatically detects available APIs on startup
2. Users can access provider settings via the gear icon in the conversation controls
3. Provider selection is instant - no page reload required
4. All features work even without API keys (using browser fallbacks)

## Next Steps

The API integration is complete and ready for production use. Consider:

1. Adding API usage monitoring and analytics
2. Implementing cost tracking for paid APIs
3. Adding more voice provider options
4. Creating admin interface for API management

All requested functionality has been implemented: the application now uses proper APIs for both voice services and ChatGPT/OpenAI integration.
